# Project History: Joe

## Completed Tickets

### F1: UI Setup and Component Library
- Set up Jest with Next.js using built-in `next/jest` configuration
- Installed required dependencies: `ts-node` for TypeScript support
- Configured Jest to test React components with `jest-environment-jsdom`
- Created basic test structure in `__tests__` directory with passing sample tests
- Removed unnecessary Babel dependencies in favor of Next.js's built-in transformers

### F2: UI Components - Basic Structure and Tests
- Created layout component with responsive header and main content area
- Implemented BoardColumn component with empty state and task count
- Developed TaskCard component with title, description, and action buttons
- Set up Status enum and Task interface in types.ts
- Created loading state with skeleton placeholders for board
- Improved accessibility with sufficient color contrast and ARIA attributes
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests for all components with >80% coverage

### F3: Task Form Components and Tests
- Created TaskForm component for adding new tasks with title and description fields
- Implemented EditTaskForm component for editing existing tasks with status selection
- Added client-side form validation with error messages for required fields
- Developed TaskModal component for displaying forms in a modal overlay
- Ensured keyboard accessibility (Escape to close, Enter to submit)
- Added aria attributes for better accessibility
- Implemented loading states during form submission
- Wrote comprehensive tests for form validation and submission

### F4: Board Page - Data Integration and Tests
- Created fixtures module with mock task data
- Connected BoardColumn component to display tasks by status
- Implemented board page with three columns and proper data distribution
- Added create/edit task functionality with modal dialogs
- Implemented state management for tasks and modal visibility
- Added loading states during task operations
- Created tests for board page rendering and interactions
- Ensured full integration between components

## Key Decisions & Patterns

- **Component Architecture**
  - Used client components (`"use client"`) for interactive elements
  - Implemented semantic HTML (section, article, header) for accessibility
  - Created responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
  - Used aria-label and aria-labelledby for screen reader support
  - Created reusable modal component for consistent UI

- **Styling Approach**
  - Used Tailwind utility classes for consistent styling
  - Implemented hover states for interactive elements
  - Ensured text contrast ratios meet WCAG accessibility standards
  - Used CSS Grid for responsive column layout
  - Maintained consistent spacing, typography, and color usage

- **Testing Strategy**
  - Tests focused on component rendering and user interactions
  - Used @testing-library/user-event for realistic user interaction testing
  - Verified accessibility attributes in component tests
  - Created separate test files for each component
  - Added mock implementations for fixtures and data handlers

- **Form Management**
  - Implemented client-side validation with descriptive error messages
  - Used controlled components for form fields
  - Added keyboard navigation support (Escape, Enter key handling)
  - Implemented loading states during form submission
  - Reset forms after successful submission

## Current State

- **Board Structure**
  - Three columns implemented: "To Do", "Doing", "Done"
  - Interactive UI with data integration
  - Responsive design working across screen sizes
  - Create and edit functionality implemented with modals

- **UI Components**
  - All required components built and tested
  - Form components with validation and submission handling
  - Modal components for better user experience
  - Accessible markup with semantic elements and ARIA attributes

- **Next Steps**
  - Implement server actions for data persistence (F6)
  - Add delete functionality with confirmation (F7)
  - Implement drag and drop for moving tasks between columns (F8)
