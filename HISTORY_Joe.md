# Project History: Testing Setup

## Completed Tasks

- **Setup Jest with Next.js**
  - Installed required dependency: `ts-node` 
  - Configured Jest to work with Next.js using `next/jest`
  - Created and configured Jest setup file to include `@testing-library/jest-dom`
  - Created basic test structure in `__tests__` directory
  - Verified test execution with a sample Home page test

## Key Decisions

- **Testing Configuration**
  - Leveraged Next.js built-in Jest configuration with `next/jest` instead of manual Babel setup
  - Removed unnecessary Babel dependencies in favor of Next.js's built-in test transformers
  - Set up Jest to properly handle TypeScript and React components
  - Used `jest-environment-jsdom` for browser-like test environment
  - Configured test patterns to target `__tests__/**/*.test.[jt]s?(x)`

## Implementation Notes

- Added appropriate test coverage patterns for app and component directories
- Using React Testing Library for component testing
- Test command available via `npm test`
- Watch mode available via `npm run test:watch`

## Current State

- Basic test infrastructure is in place and working
- Sample test for Home page passes
- Testing follows Next.js best practices without unnecessary custom configuration
