# Project History: Joe

## Completed Tickets

### F1: UI Setup and Component Library
- Set up Jest with Next.js using built-in `next/jest` configuration
- Installed required dependencies: `ts-node` for TypeScript support
- Configured Jest to test React components with `jest-environment-jsdom`
- Created basic test structure in `__tests__` directory with passing sample tests
- Removed unnecessary Babel dependencies in favor of Next.js's built-in transformers

### F2: UI Components - Basic Structure and Tests
- Created layout component with responsive header and main content area
- Implemented BoardColumn component with empty state and task count
- Developed TaskCard component with title, description, and action buttons
- Set up Status enum and Task interface in types.ts
- Created loading state with skeleton placeholders for board
- Improved accessibility with sufficient color contrast and ARIA attributes
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests for all components with >80% coverage

## Key Decisions & Patterns

- **Component Architecture**
  - Used client components (`"use client"`) for interactive elements
  - Implemented semantic HTML (section, article, header) for accessibility
  - Created responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
  - Used aria-label and aria-labelledby for screen reader support

- **Styling Approach**
  - Used Tailwind utility classes for consistent styling
  - Implemented hover states for interactive elements
  - Ensured text contrast ratios meet WCAG accessibility standards
  - Used CSS Grid for responsive column layout
  - Maintained consistent spacing, typography, and color usage

- **Testing Strategy**
  - Tests focused on component rendering and structure
  - Verified accessibility attributes in component tests
  - Created separate test files for each component
  - Used relative import paths in tests for better portability

## Current State

- **Board Structure**
  - Three columns implemented: "To Do", "Doing", "Done"
  - Static UI components ready for data integration
  - Responsive design working across screen sizes
  - Loading state implemented with skeleton UI

- **UI Components**
  - All required components built and tested
  - Appropriate error/empty states implemented
  - Accessible markup with semantic elements and ARIA attributes

- **Next Steps**
  - Implement task form components (F3)
  - Connect components to data API endpoints (F4)
  - Add create/edit/delete functionality (F5-F6)
